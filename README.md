# Vacation Planner Program

## Introduction and Problem Statement

<p align="justify">
  Greetings, this is an extension of one of my A.I subject's assignment. Initially, it is about creating a vacation planner application using Genetic Algorithm through Python. In this project, I added more analysis and UI improvement. This project is split into 2 parts, one is application based, developed using streamlit API. The file is called mainUI.py. The other one is main_report.ipynb. It is a research based program with details analysis written as a report. Both can be run. For mainUI.py, user can interact more with the frontend UI whereas for main_report.ipynb, users can get more details and information on backend process with explanation.

## Contribution and Motivation
<p align="justify">
  Genetic Algorithm adopts the concept of natural selection which the fittest individuals are chosen for reproduction. With this instinct, stronger and more competent offsprings will be produced for the next generation. Genetic algorithm consists of 5 phases, they are population creation, fitness score assignment, selection, crossover and mutation. The last three phases are called evolution. Similar to nature, fittest individual will be selected to cross breed and create offspring with occasional mutation. This is the concept of evolution, also known as survival of the fittest. The main motivation of this project is to experiment different genetic algorithms with different evolution methods. In this project, 3 different types of selections, crossover and mutation methods are implemented for comparison analysis. In the end of this project, three graphs are used to plot different types of evolution methods' fitness score across generation. Through this project, we can learn more on different evolution functions will have different effects.
